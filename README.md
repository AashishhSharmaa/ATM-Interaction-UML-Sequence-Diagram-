# UML Sequence Diagram for ATM Interaction

## Project Overview
I recently completed a UML Sequence Diagram for an interaction that occurs at an ATM, using Lucidchart. This diagram details the step-by-step interaction between a user and the ATM system, highlighting the sequence of messages exchanged during a typical transaction, such as withdrawing cash. By illustrating the process from user authentication to the completion of the transaction, the sequence diagram provides a clear and organized view of the interaction flow.
## UML Sequence Diagram
A UML Sequence Diagram is a type of diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. It focuses on the sequence of messages exchanged between objects and the order in which these interactions occur. In the context of an ATM interaction, the sequence diagram includes:

1. **User Authentication**: The user inserts their card and enters their PIN.
2. **Validation**: The ATM communicates with the bank’s server to validate the user’s credentials.
3. **Transaction Request**: The user selects a transaction type, such as cash withdrawal.
4. **Processing**: The ATM processes the request by checking the account balance and authorizing the transaction.
5. **Dispensation**: The ATM dispenses the cash and updates the account balance.
6. **Completion**: The ATM prints a receipt and returns the card to the user.
